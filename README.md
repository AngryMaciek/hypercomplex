A *C++* library for arbitrary hypercomplex numbers from the [Cayley-Dickson algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson_construction).

The library is relatively small, it is recommended to include the header file into the main program and compile it together with the library's implementation. Alternatively, the shared library file is also provided.  

Compilation process is specified explicitly in the [YAML recipe](./.github/workflows/include.yml) for the CI workflow.  
Another [workflow recipe](./.github/workflows/install.yml) provides instructions for a global installation of the library (Unix-based operating systems).

Full API Documentation is available at [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
